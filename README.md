## <a name="aboutme">About me</a>

I am an aspiring software developer with a focus on JavaScript and React. My background is in architecture having worked in practice for the last five years. I was introduced to programming during my time in university, where I was able to test generative building designs through scripts in architectural software. This piqued my interest as I saw the potential in computational driven design based on real data, mitigating human error in design.

I continued to explore and develop new skills, most importantly starting to learn to build simple programs with JavaScript as my first language. I found the technical challenge and problem solving involved in developing programs fulfilling and wanted to learn how to build more advanced projects. This led me to [Makers Academy], a highly selective full stack software development program.

Having undertaken the software development program, I have transitioned from a registered Architect in the UK to a competent and ambitious software developer with experience in developing aesthetic, responsive and scalable web applications.

I am looking to join a team where I can utilize my strengths and hone my programming knowledge/technical skills. I hope to develop in an environment that shares my values for personal growth, leadership and wellbeing. I am eager and driven to become an asset to any team that I join.
